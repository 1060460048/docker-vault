# Consul and Docker

Consul has several moving parts so we'll start with a brief introduction to Consul's architecture and then detail how Consul interacts with Docker. Please see the [Consul Architecture](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/architecture.html) guide for more detail on all these concepts.

Each host in a Consul cluster runs the Consul agent, a long running daemon that can be started in client or server mode. Each cluster has at least 1 agent in server mode, and usually 3 or 5 for high availability. The server agents participate in a [consensus protocol](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/consensus.html), maintain a centralized view of the the cluster's state, and respond to queries about the cluster from other agents in the cluster. The rest of the agents in client mode participate in a [gossip protocol](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html) to discover other agents and check them for failures, and they forward queries about the cluster to the server agents.

Applications running on a given host communicate only with their local Consul agent, using its HTTP APIs or DNS interface. Services on the host are also registered with the local Consul agent, which shares the information with the Consul servers. Doing the most basic DNS-based service discovery using Consul, an application queries for `foo.service.consul` and gets a randomly shuffled subset of all the hosts providing service "foo". This allows services to locate each other and balance the load without any intermediate proxies. Several HTTP APIs are also available for applications doing a deeper integration with Consul's service discovery capabilities, as well as its other features such as the key/value store.

These concepts also apply when running Consul in Docker. Typically, you'll run a single Consul agent container on each host, running alongside the Docker daemon. You'll also need to configure some of the agents as servers (at least 3 for a basic HA setup). Consul should always be run with `--net=host` in Docker because Consul's consensus and gossip protocols are sensitive to delays and packet loss, so the extra layers involved with other networking types are usually undesirable and unnecessary. We will talk more about this below.

We don't cover Consul's multi-datacenter capability here, but as long as `--net=host` is used, there should be no special considerations for Docker.

# Using the Container

The container is derived from a custom Hashicorp base container that is built from BusyBox with a few additional items added. We chose BusyBox as a lightweight base with a reasonably small surface area for security concerns, but with enough functionality for development, interactive debugging, and useful health, watch, and exec scripts running under Consul in the container.

Consul always runs under [dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init), which handles reaping zombie processes and forwards signals on to all processes running in the container. We also use [gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu) to run Consul as a non-root "consul" user for better security. Finally, [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is included but not activated by default in order to expose DNS on port 53 without running Consul as a root user. These binaries are all built by HashiCorp and signed with our [GPG key](https://www.hashicorp.com/security.html), so you can verify those using the signatures included in the container. More details on the DNS configuration with dnsmasq are included in a section below.

An entry point script is provided that provides several common configurations:

* `dev` yields a fully in-memory Consul server agent suitable for development (this is the default if you run the container with no arguments)
* `client` yields a Consul agent in client mode
* `server` yields a Consul agent in server mode
* any other command gets `exec`-ed inside the container under `dumb-init`

The container exposes `VOLUME /consul/data`, which is a path were Consul will place its persisted state. This isn't used in any way when running in the `dev` configuration. For client agents, this stores some information about the cluster and the client's health checks, in case the container is restarted. For server agents, this stores the client information plus snapshots and data related to the consensus algorithm and Consul's catalog of services. For servers it is highly desirable to keep this volume's data around when restarting the containers to recover from outage scenarios.

Additionally, these entry points run consul with two [configuration directories](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html#_config_dir). There's a common directory `/consul/config` as well as one specific to client or server mode (`/consul/config/client` and `/consul/config/server`). The mode-specific directories contain files that are shipped with the container and provide good default options suggested by HashiCorp. You can override any of these settings by composing a new container and adding files to `/consul/config`, which is loaded last when starting up.

Since Consul is almost always run with `--net=host` in Docker, some care is required when configuring Consul's IP addresses. Consul has the concept of its cluster address as well as its client address. The cluster address is the address at which other Consul agents may contact a given agent. The client address is the address where other processes on the host contact Consul in order to make HTTP or DNS requests. You will typically need to tell Consul what its cluster address is when starting so that it binds to the correct interface and advertises a workable interface to the rest of the Consul agents. You'll see this in the examples below as the `-bind=<external ip>` argument to Consul.

## Running Consul for Development

```console
$ docker run hashicorp/consul
```

This runs a completely in-memory Consul server agent with default bridge networking and no services exposed on the host, which is useful for development but should not be used in production. For example, if that server is running at internal address 172.17.0.2, you can run a three node cluster for development by starting up two more instances and telling them to join the first node.

```console
$ docker run -d hashicorp/consul dev -join=172.17.0.2
... server 2 starts
$ docker run -d hashicorp/consul dev -join=172.17.0.2
... server 3 starts
```

Then, choosing any one of the container IDs, we can query for all the members in the cluster by runing a Consul CLI command:

```console
$ docker exec -t c9caabfd4c2a consul members
Node          Address          Status  Type    Build  Protocol  DC
579db72c1ae1  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   server  0.6.3  2         dc1
7e185aebe4e6  172.17.0.3:8301  left    server  0.6.3  2         dc1
93fe2309ef19  172.17.0.4:8301  alive   server  0.6.3  2         dc1
c9caabfd4c2a  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  0.6.3  2         dc1
```

Remember that Consul doesn't use the data volume in this mode - once the container stops all of your state will be wiped out, so please don't use this mode for production. Running completely on the bridge network with the development server is useful for testing multiple instances of Consul on a single machine, which is normally difficult to do because of port conflicts.

The dev entry point also starts a version of Consul's web UI on port 8500. This can be added to the other Consul configurations by supplying the `-ui` option to Consul on the command line. The web assets are bundled inside the Consul binary in the container.

## Running Consul Agent in Client Mode

```console
$  docker run -d --net=host consul client -bind=<external ip> -retry-join=<root agent ip>
==> Starting Consul agent...
==> Starting Consul agent RPC...
==> Consul agent running!
         Node name: 'linode'
        Datacenter: 'dc1'
            Server: false (bootstrap: false)
       Client Addr: 127.0.0.1 (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, DNS: 8600, RPC: 8400)
      Cluster Addr: <external ip> (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)
    Gossip encrypt: false, RPC-TLS: false, TLS-Incoming: false
             Atlas: <disabled>
...
```

This runs a Consul client agent sharing the host's network and advertising the external IP address to the rest of the cluster. Note that the agent defaults to binding its client interfaces to 127.0.0.1, which is the host's loopback interface. This would be a good configuration to use if other containers on the host also use `--net=host`, and it also exposes the agent to processes running directly on the host outside a container, such as HashiCorp's Nomad.

The `-retry-join` parameter specifies the external IP of one other agent in the cluster to use to join at startup. There are several ways to control how an agent joins the cluster, see the [agent configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html) guide for more details on the `-join`, `-retry-join`, and `-atlas-join` options.

At startup, the agent will read config JSON files from `/consul/config/client` then `/consul/config`. Data will be persisted in the `/consul/data` volume.

Here are some example queries on a host with an external IP of 66.175.220.234:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/health/service/consul?pretty
[
    {
        "Node": {
            "Node": "linode",
            "Address": "66.175.220.234",
...
```

```console
$ dig @localhost -p 8600 consul.service.consul
; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.7-Ubuntu <<>> @localhost -p 8600 consul.service.consul
; (2 servers found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 61616
;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available

;; QUESTION SECTION:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
consul.service.consul.  0       IN      A       66.175.220.234
...
```

If you want to expose the Consul interfaces to other containers via a different network, such as the bridge network, use the `-client` option for Consul:

```console
docker run -d --net=host consul client -bind=<external ip> -client=<bridge ip> -retry-join=<root agent ip>
==> Starting Consul agent...
==> Starting Consul agent RPC...
==> Consul agent running!
         Node name: 'linode'
        Datacenter: 'dc1'
            Server: false (bootstrap: false)
       Client Addr: <bridge ip> (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, DNS: 8600, RPC: 8400)
      Cluster Addr: <external ip> (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)
    Gossip encrypt: false, RPC-TLS: false, TLS-Incoming: false
             Atlas: <disabled>
...
```

With this configuration, Consul's client interfaces will be bound to the bridge IP and available to other containers on that network, but not on the host network. Note that we still keep the cluster address out on the host network for performance. Consul will also accept the `-client=0.0.0.0` option to bind to all interfaces.

## Running Consul Agent in Server Mode

```console
$ docker run -d --net=host consul server -bind=<external ip> -retry-join=<root agent ip> -bootstrap-expect=<number of server agents>
```

This runs a Consul server agent sharing the host's network. All of the network considerations and behavior we covered above for the client agent also apply to the server agent. A single server on its own won't be able to form a quorum and will be waiting for other servers to join.

Just like the client agent, the `-retry-join` parameter specifies the external IP of one other agent in the cluster to use to join at startup. There are several ways to control how an agent joins the cluster, see the [agent configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html) guide for more details on the `-join`, `-retry-join`, and `-atlas-join` options. The server agent also consumes a `-bootstrap-expect` option that specifies how many server agents to watch for before bootstrapping the cluster for the first time. This provides an easy way to get an orderly startup with a new cluster. See the [agent configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html) guide for more details on the `-bootstrap` and `-bootstrap-expect` options.

At startup, the agent will read config JSON files from `/consul/config/server` then `/consul/config`. Data will be persisted in the `/consul/data` volume.

Once the cluster is bootstrapped and quorum is achieved, you must use care to try to keep the minimum number of servers operating in order to avoid an outage state for the cluster. The deployment table in the [consensus](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/consensus.html) guide outlines the number of servers required for different configurations. There's also an [adding/removing servers](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/servers.html) guide that describes that process, which is relevant to Docker configurations as well. The [outage recovery](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/outage.html) guide has steps to perform if servers are permanently lost. In general it's best to restart or replace servers one at a time, making sure servers are healthy before proceeding to the next server.

## Exposing Consul's DNS Server on Port 53

By default the dev, client, and server modes started by the endpoint will expose Consul's DNS server on port 8600. Because this is cumbersome to configure with facilities like `resolv.conf`, we have bundled a dnsmasq DNS server in the container, but it's disabled by default. It can be enabled for any of the entry point modes by setting the following options:

```console
$ docker run --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e "CONSUL_ENABLE_DNSMASQ=1" hashicorp/consul
```

Both parts are required. The `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` option allows dnsmasq to start as the "root" user and then downgrade to "nobody" once it has bound to port 53, and the `-e "CONSUL_ENABLE_DNSMASQ=1"` option is used by the entry point script to start dnsmasq. The script is set up so that if the dnsmasq or Consul process dies, everything else in the container is killed, so Consul and dnsmasq behave as a single process in that respect.

At startup, dnsmasq will read configuration files in `/dnsmasq/config`, so if you create your own container based on Consul, you can add additional configuration there.

If you are binding Consul's client interfaces to the host's loopback address, then you should be able to configure your host's `resolv.conf` to route DNS requests to Consul by including "127.0.0.1" as the primary DNS server. Due to Docker's built-in DNS server, you can't point to this directly from inside your containers; Docker will issue an error message if you attempt to do this.

If you are binding Consul's client interfaces to the bridge or other network, you can use the `--dns` option in your _other containers_ in order for them to use dnsmasq in the Consul container. Here's an example:

```console
$ docker run -d --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e "CONSUL_ENABLE_DNSMASQ=1" consul client -bind=<external ip>
```

Now start another container and point it at Consul's DNS via dnsmasq, using the bridge address of the host:

```console
$ docker run -i --dns=172.17.0.1 -t ubuntu sh -c "apt-get install -y dnsutils && dig consul.service.consul"
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
consul.service.consul.  0       IN      A       66.175.220.234
...
```

## Service Discovery with Containers

There are several approaches you can use to register services running in containers with Consul. For manual configuration, your containers can use the local agent's APIs to register and deregister themselves, see the [Agent API](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/agent.html) for more details. Another strategy could be to create a derived Consul container for each host type which includes JSON config files for Consul to parse at startup, see [Services](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/services.html) for more information. Both of these approaches are fairly cumbersome, and the configured services may fall out of sync if containers die or additional containers are started.

If you run your containers under [HashiCorp's Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) scheduler, it has [first class support for Cosnul](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/servicediscovery.html). The Nomad agent runs on each host alongside the Consul agent. When jobs are scheduled on a given host, the Nomad agent automatically takes care of syncing the Consul agent with the service information. This is very easy to manage, and even services on hosts running outside of Docker containers can be managed by Nomad and registered with Consul. You can find out more about running Docker under Nomad in the [Docker Driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html) guide.

Another option is the open source [Registrator](http://gliderlabs.com/registrator/latest/) project from Glider Labs. Registrator works by running a Registrator instance on each host, alongside the Consul agent. Registrator monitors the Docker daemon for container stop and start events, and handles service registration with Consul using the container names and exposed ports as the service information. Here's a complete example.

Run a development Consul server:

```console
$ docker run -d --net=host hashicorp/consul dev -bind=66.175.220.234 # <- use your own external IP
```

Now start a companion Registrator instance:

```console
$ docker run -d --net=host --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock gliderlabs/registrator:latest consul://localhost:8500
```

Now run some services:

```console
$ docker run -d -P redis
$ docker run -d -P redis
$ docker run -d -P redis
```

And query for them using Consul's API:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/service/redis?pretty
[
    {
        "Node": "linode",
        "Address": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServiceID": "linode:boring_noyce:6379",
        "ServiceName": "redis",
        "ServiceTags": [],
        "ServiceAddress": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServicePort": 32775,
        "ServiceEnableTagOverride": false,
        "CreateIndex": 8,
        "ModifyIndex": 8
    },
    {
        "Node": "linode",
        "Address": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServiceID": "linode:kickass_swartz:6379",
        "ServiceName": "redis",
        "ServiceTags": [],
        "ServiceAddress": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServicePort": 32776,
        "ServiceEnableTagOverride": false,
        "CreateIndex": 7,
        "ModifyIndex": 7
    },
    {
        "Node": "linode",
        "Address": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServiceID": "linode:sick_euclid:6379",
        "ServiceName": "redis",
        "ServiceTags": [],
        "ServiceAddress": "66.175.220.234",
        "ServicePort": 32777,
        "ServiceEnableTagOverride": false,
        "CreateIndex": 6,
        "ModifyIndex": 6
    }
]
```

Note that in the example above that the service address is the same as the external address of the host, and that the service ports are the mapped ports exposed on the host (32775, 32776, 32777). There are configuration options that control which IP and port Registrator gives to Consul, which may need to be adjusted depending on your network configuration. See Registrator's [Run Reference](http://gliderlabs.com/registrator/latest/user/run/) for more details.
